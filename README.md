### Papers

- [Paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2826/T2-10.pdf) - [HASOC 2020 conference](https://hasocfire.github.io/hasoc/2020/) describes our team's approach to the solution submitted using Bert Fine-tuning for the Identification of Hate Speech and Offensive Language in Indo-European Languages. 
  - **Abstract**: This article describes our team Chrestotesâ€™ approach to the solution submitted to HASOC 2020: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo- European Languages. We demonstrate an end to end solution to the fine-grained detection of hate speech in tweets. Our solution is focused on the English Task which has been split into two subtasks. Our model achieved macro-average f1- scores of 0.4969 and 0.2652 on the subtasks A and B respectively. This solution places us in the middle of the leaderboard for subtask A and first place for subtask B.
